# Clustering algorithms

## Brief overview
A most common problem that we face in big data is segmentation data into homogeneous group based on their characteristic. For example, large distribution group have to  segment theirs customers/audiences into groups of similar characteristics (needs, location, interests or demographics) where target and personalization, under it, is an immense business. Or in social network analysis, we have to examine qualitative and quantitative social structures, group of populations, nodes and connections etc... This interesting work is known as Clustering.

Clustering is the process of classifying objects into a number of groups wherein each group, objects are very similar to each other than those objects in other groups. Simply, segmenting groups with similar properties/behaviour and assign them into clusters. So, given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group without knowing of their real classes. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

There are many algorithm of clustering such as k-means, k-medoids, Ascendant/Descendant Hierarchical Classificaton, Spectral Clustering,...

Here I will present three popular clustering algorithms: k-means, k-medoids, Ascendant/Descendant Hierarchical Classification to classify some data under R and Python Software.
